  ```typescript
  interface WellnessSignal {
    type: "check-in" | "task" | "calendar-event" | "sleep" | "activity";
    timestamp: string;
    value: number;
    metadata?: Record<string, any>;
  }
  ```

## 3. Machine Learning and Risk Assessment

### Heuristic Development: Create baseline rules or models that capture meaningful burnout risk signals (e.g., increased meeting load combined with poor sleep).

**Risk Signal Heuristics:**

- **Sleep Quality Correlation**: Poor sleep + high meeting load = increased risk
- **Energy Level Patterns**: Declining energy over time = risk indicator
- **Task Urgency Impact**: High overdue tasks + low sleep = critical risk
- **Meeting Frequency**: Sudden increase in meetings = stress indicator

**Baseline Rules Implementation:**

- **Scoring Algorithm**: Implemented in `backend/ml/heuristics/forecast-engine.ts`
- **Multi-factor Analysis**: Combines sleep, energy, meetings, and task data
- **Threshold-based Classification**: Risk levels based on composite scores
- **Confidence Scoring**: Statistical confidence based on data quality and quantity

### Risk Scoring: Define risk levels (low, moderate, high, critical) and compute confidence scores using statistical or lightweight ML methods.

**Risk Level Classification:**

- **Low Risk**: Score ‚â• 67, "Clear Skies" weather
- **Moderate Risk**: Score 34-66, "Partly Cloudy" weather
- **High Risk**: Score < 34, "Storm Watch" weather
- **Critical Risk**: Score < 20, "Critical Storm" weather

**Confidence Scoring:**

- **Data Quality Assessment**: Based on signal count and consistency
- **Statistical Confidence**: Calculated from data variance and sample size
- **Default Confidence**: 70% for initial forecasts
- **Dynamic Adjustment**: Confidence increases with more data points

**Scoring Implementation:**

```typescript
const overallScore = Math.round(
  signals.reduce((s, cur) => s + (isFinite(cur.value) ? cur.value : 0), 0) /
    Math.max(1, signals.length)
);
```

### Trend Analysis: Analyze wellness signal trajectories to detect improving or declining patterns.

**Trend Detection:**
