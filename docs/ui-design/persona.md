## Erika's Perspective on AI Well-Being Solutions

### The Challenge She Sees

_"Burnout is a real risk in our environment. There are weeks where I'm juggling 5–7 projects across departments, and I've seen teammates slowly disengage—not because they're lazy, but because they're exhausted and not being heard. By the time HR or management notices, it's often too late."_

### Her Concerns About AI Monitoring

_"How do we balance care with control? I've read about AI-powered tools that monitor mouse activity, keyboard inputs, or video presence. That honestly creeps me out. Productivity isn't always visible through activity logs. Just because I'm not typing doesn't mean I'm not thinking."_

### What She Wants from AI Solutions

- A system that **supports well-being**, not just measures behavior
- **Clear communication** on what data is being collected, and why
- The ability to **see her own metrics** and contextualize them
- **Informed consent** and opt-in choice
- A system that feels like a **coach, not a camera**

### Her Bottom Line

_"If you can build AI that respects those boundaries, I'm more likely to trust and even advocate for it internally. I want a system that offers early insights without compromising dignity."_
